					h1 About Us 
					h2 Teaching Kids How to Think.
					
					p Since 1994, Morning Glory School has been offering mid-Vancouver Island families a rich alternative to public school from Preschool & Kindergarten through Grades 1-3, 4-6, 7 and 8, in a home-like, creative school community.  Morning Glory School curriculum covers BC Ministry of Education learning objectives, using a more balanced approach to learning inspired by the teachings of Rudolf Steiner, the founder of Waldorf Education. We strive to teach children how to think, not what to think. Our education is experiential, spirit-building but non-denominational, and interdisciplinary. Through art, nature, academics and practical skills building our goal is to prepare children to thrive in a changing world. 
					
					p We encourage you to read on about our programs, call us to arrange a visit, or attend one of our Open Houses or Public Events listed on our Morning Glory School Calendar of Events. 
					
					p Thank you for visiting.
					
					p Parents, Faculty, and Staff of Morning Glory School
