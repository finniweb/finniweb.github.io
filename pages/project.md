The Program “Freiwilliges Jahr Im Ausland” (eng.: “Voluntary year in a foreign country”) is a opportunity for young people to get to know a different Country and it’s Culture while dedicating themselves to helping other people.  
As a volunteer  you get the chance to gain a lot of experiences and step out of your normal life and dive into a completely different surrounding.

Those Programs are supported by providers like the “[Freunde der Erziehungskunst Rudolf Steiner’s](https://www.freunde-waldorf.de/en/community-service.html)".  
They provide seminars for the preparation of the Voluntary service and also work with the volunteers during their stay abroad and help with any issues that might occur.

I am carrying out my voluntary service at the [Morning Glory School](https://www.morninggloryschool.ca). The Morning Glory School is a small private school that is Waldorf inspired and tries to offer an alternative schooling for those who disagree with the public school system.
As a Volunteer I am teaching the Children in Games/Sport classes and in German. I also help out in all the other areas of the school like in Kindergarten and Preschool or supervise the children during recess etc.
