Hi, my name is Finn.

I am currently doing a voluntary year in Canada.  
I decided on doing it a couple years ago because I had heard of it and always liked the idea of going somewhere else and learning about a different culture.

I like a lot of different things and most of all I love change!  
So this year gave me the perfect opportunity to jump into something very new and very different while leaving everything else behind.  
This year also gives me the opportunity to find myself and become an adult before going to university.

I would recommend everyone to do a voluntary year (usually right after school) and I think if everyone did, our world would become a more compassionate and peaceful place.

If you are thinking about a voluntary year and note sure about it... Do it!
Also if you have any questions you can always contact me at [mail@finnweb.com](mailto:mail@finniweb.com)
