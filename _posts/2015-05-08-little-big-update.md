My voluntary year is nearing it's end and I still have a hard time believing it. In little more then a month school will be over here. I won't leave the Country right away but it still marks the end of my Voluntary work.

I can't deny being a little excited for the things that are awaiting me afterwards but now that I have figured out a couple things I feel that I could use a little more time. 
Talking about time, the last few months have been busy:
We hosted a Mexican exchange student for two weeks. So we had a full house. It was a lot of fun though.
I decided to make some changes to the finniweb page and  had to rebuild everything. But it was completely worth it. The website should load much faster now.
Also I went to Cape Scott Provincial Park in the very north of Vancouver Island.
On Easter my (host)-family and I went out fishing. 
Later I had 2 weeks of holidays that I used to visit some friends in Vancouver.
I also got up early a couple of times to catch the sunrise and it earned me some amazing photos, you can check them out in the gallery.

I am still quite busy, so I will upload some of my photos. They often speak more than words... and it takes less time to translate them.
